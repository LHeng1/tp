### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

### \[Proposed\] Hide/unhide feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism introduces the capability to selectively hide certain applicants from view, improving user experience and providing greater control over the displayed information. This also includes a way to view all hidden applicants in a list. This feature implements the following operations:
* `HideCommand#execute()` — Hides the specified applicant from the list.
* `UnhideCommand#execute()` — Unhides the specified applicant from the list.
* `UnhideAllCommand#execute()` — Unhides all hidden applicants.
* `ListHiddenCommand#execute()` — Displays a list of all hidden applicants.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the hide/unhide mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The applicant list displays all applicants without any hidden applicants.

Step 2. The user decides to hide the 3rd applicant in the applicant list by executing hide 3. The `hide` command calls `Model#setPerson()` to replace the applicant with a hidden version.  `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the list of applicants displayed in the UI to exclude the hidden applicant.

Step 3. The user executes `list hidden` to view all hidden applicants. The `list hidden` command calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the list of applicants displayed in the UI to include only hidden applicants.

Step 4. The user decides to unhide the 1st applicant in the hidden applicant list by executing unhide 1. The `hide` command calls `Model#setPerson()` to replace the hidden applicant with a non-hidden version. The `unhide` command calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the list of applicants displayed in the UI to include the unhidden applicant.

Step 5. Alternatively, the user can choose to unhide all hidden applicants by executing unhide all. The `unhide all` command creates a copy of the model and calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` and `Model#getFilteredPersonList()` on that model to receive a list of hidden applicants. It then replaces every hidden person in the original model with a non-hidden version by calling `Model#setPerson()`. The `unhide all` command calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to update the list of applicants displayed in the UI to include all unhidden applicants.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![HideSequenceDiagram](images/HideSequenceDiagram.png)


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/HideActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

### Bookmark/Unbookmark feature

#### Implementation

The bookmark/unbookmark mechanism gives users the ability to bookmark or unbookmark certain applicants they want to take note of, as well as list these bookmarked applicants. This allows users to better differentiate between a long list of applicants, improving the ease of usage of this application and user experience. This feature implements the following operations:
* `BookmarkCommand#execute()` — Bookmarks a specified applicant.
* `UnbookmarkCommand#execute()` — Unbookmarks a specified applicant.
* `ListBookmarkedCommand#execute()` — Displays a list of all bookmarked applicants.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the bookmark/unbookmark mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. TAfinder will be initialized with imported data, wherein all applicants will begin as unbookmarked.

Step 2. The user executes `bookmark 5` command to bookmark the 5th applicant in TAfinder. The `bookmark` command calls `Model#setPerson()`, resulting in a copy of the original applicant, now modified to be bookmarked, being stored in the list of applicants after the `bookmark 5` command executes. Additionally, the UI is updated to indicate that the applicant is now bookmarked via the bookmark flag.

Step 3. After bookmarking a number of applicants, the user now decides that bookmarking the 2nd applicant was a mistake, and decides to unbookmark them by executing the `unbookmark 2` command. The unbookmark command will call `Model#setPerson()`, resulting in a copy of the original applicant, now modified to be unbookmarked, being stored in the list of applicants after the `unbookmark 2` command executes. Once again, the UI is updated to indicate that the applicant is now unbookmarked via the bookmark flag.

Step 4. The user then decides to view all bookmarked applicants by executing the `list-bookmarked` command. The `list-bookmarked` command calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()`, which updates the list of applicants presented in the UI to only include bookmarked applicants.


### Compare feature

#### Implementation

The compare mechanism allows users to compare two distinct TA applicants in the TAfinder app. The compare mechanism is mainly facilitated by the `CompareCommand`, `CompareCommandParser`, and `CompareWindow` classes. It extends the abstract class `Command` with an `execute` functionality, to facilitate the execution of the command. Specifically, the compare feature is implemented through the following components and operations:

- `CompareCommand` — Core component responsible for executing the comparison of two TA applicants in the list.
- `Person` — Represents the TA applicants with their respective fields, such as `Gpa`, to be used for comparison.
- `CompareCommandParser` — Contains the functionalities for user input parsing. It ensures that user input is valid as a compare command by meeting specific requirements.
- `CompareWindow` — Main User Interface (UI) for after a compare command is successfully executed. It will display the content of the two TA applicants side by side.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the compare mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 0. Assume that there is an existing list of applicants in the application after launch.

Step 1. The user enters the compare command `compare 1 2` to compare the first and second applicants in the existing list. The `CompareCommandParser` is invoked to parse the user's input.

Step 2. `CompareCommandParser` will then invoke `ParserUtil` for parsing of the indices and check for index errors. If indices are invalid, the system will generate an error message. The error message will be displayed to the user, providing clear feedback about the issue and the specific constraints that are not met.

Step 3. If indices are valid, `CompareCommand#execute()` fetches the two intended applicants from the currently visible list and ensures that both indexes do not point to the same applicant.

Step 4. Then, `CompareCommand#execute()` creates a new `CompareWindow` instance which is immediately shown, with the two applicants' information passed to `CompareWindow`, in the form of the `Person` model.

The following sequence diagram displays how the compare function works until Step 4:

![CompareSequenceDiagram](images/CompareSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 5. `CompareWindow` handles the GUI presentation aspects, in the form of a pop-up window. It uses the JavaFX `GridPane` layout to display the respective `Person` attributes side-by-side.

Step 6. A success message is displayed to the user to confirm that the comparison of applicants is successful.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `compare` command:

![CompareActivityDiagram](images/CompareActivityDiagram.png)

### \[Proposed\] Comment feature

#### Implementation
The comment command allows users to insert a comment on TA applicants in TAfinder app. 
The comment mechanism is mainly facilitated by the `CommentCommand` and `CommentCommandParser` classes. It extends the abstract class `Command` with an `execute` functionality, to facilitate the execution of the command. Specifically, the comment feature is implemented through the following components and operations:

- `CommentCommand` — Core component responsible for executing the adding of comments to a TA applicant in the list.
- `CommentCommand#execute` — Adds the comment to the specific applicant in the list.
- `CommentCommandParser` — Contains the functionalities for user input parsing. It ensures that user input is valid as a compare command by meeting specific requirements.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the comment mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The applicant list displays all applicants.

Step 2. The user decides to comment on the 3rd applicant in the applicant list with `Hardworking` as the comment by executing `comment 3 Hardworking`. The `CommentCommmandParser` is invoked to parse the user's input.

Step 3. `CommmentCommandParser` will then invoke ParserUtil for parsing of the index and check for index errors. If the index is invalid, the system will generate an error message. The error message will be displayed to the user, providing clear feedback about the issue and the specific constraints that are not met.

Step 4. If the index is valid, `CommentCommand#execute()` fetches the intended applicant from the currently visible list and adds the comment `Hardworking` to the applicant with the corresponding index. The adding of comment is destructive, meaning if the specified applicant has an existing comment, it will be overwritten.

Step 5. Then, `CommentCommand#execute()` updates `Model#setModel` with the updated Person. Displaying the updated applicant list with the comment added.

Step 6. A success message is displayed to the user to confirm that the comment has been added to the applicant successfully.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Comparison GUI:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Compare two applicants in one pop-up window.
    * Pros: 
      1. Easier to implement the pop-up window
      2. Able to avoid over-dependencies within the UI component.
    * Cons: Design may not be uniform with main window.

* **Alternative 2:** Compare two applicants in the main window.
    * Pros:
      1. Easy view of information.
    * Cons:
      1. Difficult to implement the UI change when a compare command is inputted, as whole window needs to be modified.
      2. Inconvenient to refer back to list of applicants if needed.

* **Alternative 3:** Compare multiple (two or more) applicants.
    * Pros: More convenient to choose between applicants.
    * Cons: Harder to implement the UI.




### Attach feature

#### Implementation

The attach feature allows users to attach files to TA applicants in the app. Attaching files *copies* these files into the `data` directory and adds a reference to those files to that `Person` model. This means that even if the original files are deleted, TAfinder would still have access to the copies of those files.

The attachment mechanism is mainly facilitated by the `AttachCommand`, `AttachCommandParser`, and `Attachment` classes. It extends the abstract class `Command` with an `execute` functionality, to facilitate the execution of the command. Specifically, the compare feature is implemented through the following components and operations:

- `AttachCommand` — Core component responsible for executing the comparison of two TA applicants in the list.
- `AttachCommandParser` — Contains the functionalities for user input parsing. It ensures that user input is valid as an attach command by meeting specific requirements.
- `Person` — Represents the TA applicants with their respective fields, such as `Attachment`, to attach files to.
- `Attachment` — Represents a reference to a file. This can be a file that has been "attached" to a `Person`, or just a file within the file system of the computer.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the attach mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 0. Assume that there is an existing list of applicants in the application after launch.

Step 1. The user enters the compare command `attach 1 f/Downloads/resume.pdf f/Downloads/cv.txt` to attach the files `resume.pdf` and `cv.txt` in the `Downloads` directory to the first user in the visible list.

Step 2. `AttachCommandParser` will then invoke `ParserUtil` for parsing of the index and check for index errors, and then parses the file paths to check for any invalid path characters. If index is invalid or the file path contains invalid path characters, the system will generate an error message. The error message will be displayed to the user, providing clear feedback about the issue and the specific constraints that are not met.

Step 3. If indices are valid, `AttachCommand#execute()` fetches the intended applicant from the currently visible list.

Step 4. Then, `AttachCommand#execute()` copies each attachment into the `data` directory, to the path `data/attachments/{student number}/{filename}`.

Step 5. Finally, a success message is displayed to the user indicating the number of attachments that have been copied.
